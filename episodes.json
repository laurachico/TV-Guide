Noted for its topical sketches and skits, it made stars of Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, Griff Rhys-Jones and Pamela Stephenson.  The show required a large number of writers, and to this end operated an \"open door\" policy, accepting sketch ideas from anybody who wanted to contribute. With a large number of contributing writers, there was plenty of material to go round, and only the best ideas made it to the screen; thus the series was able to maintain a remarkably high quality of material across four series.  The series ended in 1982, partly due to the various cast members wanting to pursue their own projects instead.",

Sabrina's legacy lived on after the 1970's, as the repulsive Rotunda Repulsa, a troll with a power hunger, turned Sabrina into an adolescent. That started the 1999 revival series, which was 'supposedly' spun off the live-action show, whilst it was actually supposed to be started a few years after cancellation of the orginal Sabrina cartoon. Lucky for us, it did not. The live-action show made it popular, and the show that originally was not, came to be better than it was originally planned. The further adventures of Sabrina appear in Sabrina comic books, published by Archie Comics, which is where this whole \"chaos\" began! :)",

Under the moniker \"ideas worth spreading,\" talks were released online. They rapidly attracted a global audience in the millions. Indeed, the reaction was so enthusiastic that the entire TED website has been reengineered around TEDTalks, with the goal of giving everyone on-demand access to the world's most inspiring voices.",
